> # Important Notes
> By now, we have hit 100 stars. A massive thanks to everyone who has explored and starred this project. I am deeply proud to have built a globally unique tool that takes a completely different, unconventional approach to Windows customization. 
> 
> While it's true that much of the code is written with the assistance of AI, bringing this vision to life is VERY FAR from automated. It requires countless hours of typography problem-solving, 
testing many of the fonts and scenarios, and brainstorming new features —and I currently do all of this entirely **ON MY OWN.** 
> 
> Because of that, I want to remind everyone that this is an open-source initiative, and **contributions are always welcome!** Whether it's submitting pull requests or sharing ideas and solutions, your input is highly appreciated as I continue to push the boundaries of what this tool can do.

# SyrianSegoe
**A Next-Gen Windows System Font Setting Tool**

SyrianSegoe is a powerful, system-wide font replacement tool for Windows. It completely replaces the default "Segoe UI" font with a modded font of your choice. Because it patches the font files directly, it seamlessly applies your custom font across the entire OS, including modern UI elements that usually resist customization.

<table>

## ✨ Features
* **True System-Wide Replacement:** Works flawlessly on UWP apps, the Windows 11 Taskbar, Settings, Welcome and Login UI.
* **Arabic UI Font Support:** Fully supports combining a primary Latin font with a secondary Arabic base font for a perfect bilingual UI.
* **Auto-Detection:** Automatically detects all font weights when you select a Regular font file.
* **Built-in Backup & Restore:** Automatically backs up your original Segoe UI fonts and allows you to restore them with a single click.
* **Multi-language UI:** Available in English, Turkish, and Arabic.

## 🆚 Why SyrianSegoe? 
In the past, the standard way to change Windows fonts was using the **Registry `FontSubstitutes` method**. 

**The Problem with `FontSubstitutes`:** Modern Windows components (like UWP apps, the Start Menu, and the modern Taskbar) strictly request the "Segoe UI" font by name and often ignore registry substitutions. This results in a mismatched UI where half the system uses your custom font and the other half uses the default Segoe UI.

**SyrianSegoe** takes a different approach. It uses FontForge to generate a modified version of your chosen font that impersonates Segoe UI. Because the system recognizes it as the original font, it ensures complete UI consistency without breaking system components..

---

## 🔠 Supported Fonts
All fonts designed for UI usage are fully supported, **including Variable Fonts**. Even if your chosen font is missing certain static weights (such as Light or SemiBold), the program will automatically slice or generate the missing weights for you.

### Tested & Verified Fonts
The following fonts have been tested and work beautifully:
* **Latin:** SF Pro Display, MiSans, Ubuntu, Instagram Sans
* **Arabic:** SF Arabic, Noto Naskh Arabic, Cairo


### Tested on:
* **Windows 10:** 21H2
* **Windows 11:** 24H2, 25H2

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run as Administrator:** The program requires Admin privileges to modify system fonts.
2. **Select Latin Fonts:** Browse for your primary Latin Regular font. The app will attempt to automatically find the Bold and Black weights in the same folder.
3. **Select Arabic Fonts (Optional):** If you use an Arabic system language or keyboard, select your preferred Arabic fonts in the second section.
4. **Build & Apply:** Click the green "Build & Apply" button. (If you don't have FontForge installed, the app will offer to install it for you automatically via `winget`).
5. **Reboot:** Restart your PC to see the changes take effect system-wide!

*To revert, simply open the app and click **Restore Original Fonts**.*
